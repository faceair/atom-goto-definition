## Performance Mode

Performance mode is 10x faster then nomal model. if you want a better experience, please open the performance mode.

Steps:

1. Install `ripgrep`, see [https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation). Yeap, now we use `ripgrep` to search definitions, because of it's incredibly fast.
2. Turn `Settings -> Packages -> goto-definition -> Settings -> Performance Mode` on.
3. Enjoy it.

Now the performance model is still testing, welcome suggestions and feedback. If it goes well, we will open the performance mode by default in the next version.

### Ignoring files

In performance mode, if you want ignore some files, you can create a file called `.ignore` in the root of the project, it working like `.gitignore`.

### Notice

* In nomal model, if you want include VCS ignored paths, please turn `Settings -> Exclude VCS Ignored Paths` option off.
